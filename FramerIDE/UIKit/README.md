# FramerIDE UIKit

This directory contains the design language and UI components for the FramerIDE mobile experience.
Designed by the Framer Team.

## Core Principles
- **Mini-App Focused**: tailored for building simple, lightweight mobile experiences (like Farcaster Frames).
- **Zero Complexity**: No heavy frameworks. Just pure, clean HTML & CSS.
- **Mobile-Native Feel**: Optimized for touch, full-screen, and fluid interactions.
- **Framer-esque**: High-quality aesthetics out of the box.

## Structure
- `tokens.css`: Core design variables.
- `global.css`: Base styles to make any HTML page look like a mobile app instantly.
- `components/`: Simple, copy-pasteable UI elements.

## Design Inspiration
This UIKit draws heavy inspiration from the **Maxcloud** design language ("Porcelain Aesthetics"). It distills those premium, high-fidelity principles into a lightweight, mobile-first package. 

It serves as a testbed for refining interactions (like the double-sheet stack and native-feel carousel) that may eventually flow back into the core Maxcloud design system.
